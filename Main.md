# Introduction #

This is a Bullet physics engine integration in Unity.

Currently it's using [BulletSharp](https://code.google.com/p/bulletsharp/)'s PInvoke branch. I'm considering adding an abstraction layer and introducing [bullet-xna](https://code.google.com/p/bullet-xna/)'s NoXna branch as alternative for webplayers and non pro users.
